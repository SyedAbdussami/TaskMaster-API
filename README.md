# TaskMaster-API

Welcome to the Task Manager API project repository. This endeavor is an ongoing work, with updates and daily efforts continually being added.

The primary objective of this project is to cultivate a robust proficiency in constructing a Spring Boot application, focusing on pivotal aspects including User Registration, Authentication, and Authorization.

The core intent revolves around executing the backend facet of a conventional task manager application, covering various essential functionalities. This repository will encompass all the essential parts and components that form the backbone of the business logic. From managing task assignments to tracking completed work, project statuses, and thorough task work reviews, I aim to develop a versatile and efficient system.

As I continue to refine and expand the functionality of this API, you can anticipate regular updates and improvements. I am committed to delivering a reliable and dynamic solution that showcases my evolving skills in application development.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this repository. Your interest and feedback are greatly appreciated. 

Cheers
