# Task-Manager-API

This project is a work in progress. I add updates or try to work on this daily.

My aim is to gain sufficient proficiency in building a Spring boot application encompassing critical components such as User Registration, Authentication and Authorization. 

I plan to implement the backend component of a typical task manager application. 

This repo will consist solely of all the parts and pieces that comprise the business logic. 


Cheers
